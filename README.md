#  HTML5 Boilerplate (Wordpress Barebones Remix)

This is a Wordpress template aimed at being a starting point for personalised wordpress templates.

## Manifesto

The goal of this project is to create a Wordpress theme is the completely faithful to the latest version of the HTML5 specification. 

As a secondary goal, this template attempts to be as cross-device and cross-browser as possible, by harnessing the powerful semantics of HTML5. To that end, this project is a branch of the [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/paulirish/html5-boilerplate).
